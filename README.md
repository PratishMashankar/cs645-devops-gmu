# Containerizing Student Survey Form
Our project embarked on a journey to enhance the deployment and management of the web application developed during Homework 1 â€“ Part 2. To achieve this, we harnessed the power of Docker container technology to containerize the application, facilitating seamless deployment and scaling. The next step involved orchestrating these containers on the open-source Kubernetes platform, ensuring the application's resilience and scalability. We opted for a baseline configuration with a minimum of three pods continuously running, considering Rancher for Kubernetes cluster setup. Furthermore, our endeavor culminated in establishing a robust CI/CD pipeline, complete with a Git source code repository hosted on GitHub and Jenkins for automated building and deployment of the application on our Kubernetes cluster.
